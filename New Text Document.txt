Structuring machine learning projects is an integral skill that every machine learning engineer or an enthusiast requires to establish a hold on the concept an this course serves the exact purpose, My particular reason to apply for financial aid is my belief in financial freedom of the students all over, which basically means that the students no longer burden their parents financially for educational purposes, since college education is very expensive these days , As in my case . Machinelearning and any Artificial intelligence related courses are not provided in my college coursera is the only platform where I can pursue this interest of mine along with my bachelors degree and as college education is very expensive and my parents have already been generous enough to provide this opportunity to pursue my dreams I don't intend to burden them even more with the cost of my courses, If a student is financially free he/she may pursue the study of choice, which I believe is the motive behind Coursera providing financial aid to their students.
This Course being the 3rd of the deeplearning Specialization is an integral part of the course, as it deals with the process of deploying and structuring machine learning projects and shows a powerful and a well put together approach to create machine learning projects, having completed the two previous courses of the deeplearning specialization I am very keen on completing this course as well to successfully deploy my own machine learning project, which aligns with my career goals to become a machine learning pioneer and have my own company and work out solutions for the world using machine learning and deepleraning concepts and to get the opportunity to learn from Mr. Andrew Ng is an honor, and will have a very positive effect on my efforts to establish my knowledge in the subject and in turn my professional inclination, as has been in the previous courses I had completed under his expertise.   
I cannot afford to take up a low interest loan to pay for the course as I believe in students being financially free to take up their choice of education. And also because I am already on an education loan to pay for my college
